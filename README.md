## Note on Dataset and Model Files

Please note that the dataset used in this project is not publicly distributed in this repository due to data sharing restrictions.  
If you are interested in accessing the dataset, please refer to the [Semantic Segmentation for Improving Automated Driving](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/cityscapes-image-pairs/data).

Additionally, the pre-trained `.pt` model files are not included in this repository because of their large file size.  
If you require the model weights, please feel free to contact me, and I will provide instructions for obtaining them separately.
